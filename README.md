# Bayesian Network for Medical Diagnosis

This was a course assignment for *COV884 - Special Module in Artificial Intelligence*

Given the Bayesian Network, we had to learn the network from a healthcare dataset. The dataset contains records of around 11100 patients with a maximum of 1 missing record. More information about the problem statement and the results can be found in *assignment.pdf* and *Writeup.pdf*.
